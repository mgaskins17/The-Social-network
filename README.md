## Installation

I provide a video of working through the program itself, but if you want to use the program on your machine please follow the listed steps:
    a. Clone the repo from my github found at https://github.com/mgaskins17/The-Social-network on to your local device
    b. Open the integrated terminal by right clicking on index.js found in the root then type "npm i" to install the required dependencies
    c. Assuming you're a user only - use the command "node index" to start the application -> IF YOU'RE A DEVELOPER, use "nodemon index" so changes will be implemented right away
    d. You'll need to use insomnia to test the different routes and use MongoDB Compass to view the databases with the collections
